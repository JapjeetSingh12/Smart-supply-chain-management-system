SMART SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
________________________________________

This project models a basic smart supply chain management system with object-oriented concepts. It includes different supply chain actors such as Suppliers, Retailers, Warehouse Operators, and System Administrators, all interacting through products, sales transactions, and purchase orders.
The application uses inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, exception handling, and file I/O techniques to simulate realistic supply chain operations.
Main Features:
●	Suppliers manage stock and add products.

●	Retailers can place orders.

●	Warehouse operators manage inventory.

●	System Administrators monitor the system.

●	File I/O for saving inventory reports.

●	Exception handling for invalid operations.
